This project provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, making it easier to understand and compare their performance. The visualizer includes popular algorithms such as bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort, and allows you to see how each algorithm sorts a list of elements step by step. Whether you're a student learning about sorting algorithms or a programmer looking to improve your understanding, this visualizer provides a fun and interactive way to explore and learn. Check out the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer now and see for yourself how these algorithms work!
