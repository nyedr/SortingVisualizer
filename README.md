# SortingVisualizer
This project provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, making it easier to understand and compare their performance. The visualizer includes popular algorithms such as bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort, and allows you to see how each algorithm sorts a list of elements step by step.
